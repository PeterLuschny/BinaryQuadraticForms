# BinaryQuadraticForms
 
Positive Numbers represented by a Binary Quadratic Form

This SageMath notebook implements the methods for calculating the numbers represented by a binary quadratic form in a uniform and efficient way and hides the complexity of the situation by providing a simple interface to the user.


The home page of the original SageMath notebook (Python2, 2014) is at the OEIS:
